# nearby-locations
This is my first project in GitHub. Anyone please comment, contribute to improve my code. This code is to find nearby locations based on your current location. The code is using Google Maps API to find nearby locations and shows the nearest location to you. Works well on mobile devices as the HTML5 Geolocation is very accurate on mobiles. However it works also on PC/ Desktop. But the location accuracy is not perfect.
